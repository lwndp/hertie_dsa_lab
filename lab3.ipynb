    "* **the `action` parameter** specifies a URL that the form data is sent to once the user clicks the button with the type `submit`\n",
    "    - in flask, the `url_for` function specifes a URL to a particular route/view of your page (in this case the `/calculate` route)\n",
    "    - so, later we will need logic that routes `/calculate` and defines an associated function for what to do with it\n",
    "\n",
    "* **the `method` parameter** means that the data that a user puts into this form will be sent to the server with the POST method \n",
    "    - the POST method is commonly used for sending form data because it keeps data private (unlike GET, which appends data to the URL)\n",
    "    - we will also need to specify this in our route\n",
    "\n",
    "* when a user presses the `submit` button of this form (which has the text 'Calculate' on it), the data that a user has put into the form gets sent to the server, which does some operations with it and then sends an HTML back to the web browser (in whatever you have defined in your code). \n",
    "    - NB: the `name` tags in the different elements represent how this data gets sent to the server.\n",
    "        - e.g. name=\"value1\": means Flask will be able to access this field using request.form['value1'] when the form is submitted.\n",
    "        - e.g. name=\"operation\": Flask will access it with request.form['operation'].\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Flask/python logic\n",
    "   \n",
    "* we now also need to change our `flask_app.py` file that contains our Flask logic, so that the server knows how to deal with this form data and execute the calculation. \n",

    "## Motivation: Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",

    "**Takeaway here**: these are inefficient / bruteforce -> divide-and-conquer algorithms can do same task more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea of Bubble Sort**: \n",
    "\n",
    "*Bubble Sort is a straightforward (i.e. naive / brute force) sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The idea is to \"bubble up\" the largest element to its correct position in each pass.*\n",
    "1. **Repeated passes**: We iterate through the array $n$ times (where $n$ is the length of the array). \n",
    "    - This ensures that every element has had enough chances to move into the right spot.\n",
    "2. **Pairwise Swapping**: for each pass:\n",
    "    - Compare each adjacent pair of elements.\n",
    "    - If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect of Swapping:\n",
    "- After the first full pass, the largest element moves to the last position.\n",
    "- After the second full pass, the second largest element is in its correct position, and so on.\n",
    "- This continues until the array is fully sorted.\n",

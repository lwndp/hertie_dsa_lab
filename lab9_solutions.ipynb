    "So all of that should be familiar from lab 8 (if not, go back through lab 8!), but we didn't spend long thinking about how to formally conceptualise and analyse why and how divide-and-conquer algorithms are more efficient than their brute force counterparts. As an important class of algorithm, there's significant work gone into thinking about how, why, and under what conditions Divide-and-Conque algorithms are efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's *intuitively* understand why MergeSort specifically is $O(n \\log n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition behind MergeSort\n",
    "\n",
    "MergeSort is a recursive algorithm (it calls itself); the most intuitive way to think about it is to 'unroll' the recurrence and look at patterns in the first few levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "   <img src=\"images/screenshot_rectree_mergesort.png\" width=\"500px\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, some points that should be immediately obvious:\n",
    "- at the top leel, the amount of 'work' (i.e. items to sort) MergeSort has to do is a function of $n$ (the size of the input array),\n",
    "- at each level of recursion, the number of subproblems we're dealing with doubles,\n",
    "- at each level of recursion, the size of each subproblem halves,\n",
    "- the total amount of 'work' thus remains constant: at $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's one insight - at all levels the amount of 'work' to be done remains $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now our problem is that if we were to do all that $n$ amount of work at the top level (without any dividing nonsense), we already know (from BubbleSort) that is $O(n^2)$. But if we Divide-and-Conquer, we can increase the efficiency of getting the same amount of work done. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking through MergeSort in terms of base cases vs levels (an unrolled recurrence)\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, at all levels, the division operation is $c$ ($O(1)$) so we can effectively ignore it and focus on the merge and recurion elements! (as a recursive algorithm, in MergeSort they are jointly handled as part of recursive workflow).\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes us down to the base-case level (when as a single-valued array, they have been sorted), and in the combine step (where they are combined *in order*). We are therefore interested in how the number of base cases, and the number of combine ooerations scale wrt input size. For an $n$ lengthed array:\n",
    "- The **number of base cases** is also $n$. This gives us the $n$ of the $O(n \\log n)$.\n",
    "- The **number of combine steps** is given by the *depth* of the recursion (i.e. how many steps does it have to take to recombine all the base cases into a single array again). As we are halving the number of subproblems at each step, this is given by $\\log n$ (the base 2 inverse exponential). This gives us the $\\log n$ of the $O(n \\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: We decomposed MergeSort in the above way because it is the most intuitive. However, it is isomorphic to (i.e., structurally equivalent to) the following decomposition, which we will use when deriving the recurrence relation:\n",
    "- **number of combine step**: $n$, as the number of comparisons we have to do between values is $n$ (every value has to be compared at one point during our combining steps)\n",
    "- **nummber of levels of recursion**: $\\log n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Top Level (Entire Array of Size $n$)**\n",
    "   - This is self-evident. \n",
    "   - We also make two recursive calls to sort the left and right halves.\n",
    "2. **Second Level (Two Subproblems of Size $n/2$)**\n",
    "   - Each of the two halves is of size $n/2$.\n",
    "   - Each half takes at most $O(n/2)$ time for merging.\n",
    "   - Since there are two such halves, the total time at this level is still $O(n)$.\n",
    "3. **Third Level (Four Subproblems of Size $n/4$)**\n",
    "   - Each subproblem is now $n/4$ in size.\n",
    "   - Each takes at most $O(n/4)$ time for merging.\n",
    "   - Since there are four such subproblems, the total time at this level remains $O(n)$.\n",
    "- **Generalizing to Deeper Levels**\n",
    "   - At each level of recursion, the total merging time remains $O(n)$ because there are always enough subproblems to sum up to $n$.\n",
    "   - The recursion continues until we reach base cases (single-element arrays).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So at level $j$: \n",
    "1. Number of Subproblems at Level $j$\n",
    "   - At each level of recursion, the number of subproblems **doubles** compared to the previous level.\n",
    "   - We start with **1 subproblem** (the entire array), after $j$ levels, there are: $2^j \\text{ subproblems}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Size of Each Subproblem at Level $j$\n",
    "   - The array is divided in half at every level.\n",
    "   - After $j$ levels, each subproblem is of size: $\\frac{n}{2^j}$:\n",
    "      - after **one split**, the size is $ n/2 $, \n",
    "      - after **two splits**, it's $ n/4 $, \n",
    "      - and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Total Work Done at Level $j$\n",
    "   - As before, the division operation is done in constant time, so it drops out. This leaves us just with merging and recursion.\n",
    "   - Each of the $ 2^j $ subproblems requires at most $ O(n/2^j) $ time for merging.\n",
    "   - Since there are $ 2^j $ such subproblems, the total work done at level $j$ is: $2^j \\cdot \\frac{n}{2^j} = n$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key point to get here is that the total work remains $ O(n) $ at **every** level!**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Summing Over All Levels\n",
    "   - The recursion continues until we reach base cases where the subproblem size is **1**.\n",
    "   - The number of levels required to reduce $ n $ down to **1** is the number of times we can halve $ n $:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\\log_2 n$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Since we do **$ O(n) $ work at each level**, and there are $ O(\\log n) $ levels, the total time complexity is:\n",
    "   $$O(n \\log n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fomalising that intuition\n",

    "This makes intuitive sense. We already looked at why it is $O(n \\log n)$, and we also said in lab 8 that the 'magic' happens as MergeSort merges the lists into sorted lists or increasing size; this is done at the every combining stage of every recursive step. This validates what we already knew, but as a formalised theorem, the Master Theorem also gives us the tools to generalise this to the whole class of algorithms.\n",

Let's first create a simple bar chart as an example (example taken from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-visualization-with-plotly-and-flask-3660abf9c946)). You can either add this dashboard page to your own personal flask app (for which you have created your about page) or you can clone [this](https://github.com/henrycgbaker/my_flask_app_25) repo.\n",

    "First you need to get the correct **python modules and packages** in place:\n",

    "    - `plotly`\n",
    "    - `pandas`\n",

    "Next, you need to **initialise the database** in a python shell:\n",
    "- in the command line run `python` while in the `my_flask_app` project root directory and with your flask environment activated\n",
    "- next, run the following (I recommend running it line by line to get a sense of what we're doing here):\n",

    "- line 3: tells SQLAlchemy to create all missing tables based on the models defined in `models.py`.\n",
    "    - If the tables already exist, this does nothing (it does not override existing tables).\n",
    "    - If this is the first time running it, it sets up an empty database with tables corresponding to all models.\n",

    "    - The `User` constructor assigns \"Default user\" to the name column.\n",
    "    - At this stage, user is just an object in memory.\n",

    "We now create a dashboard for tracking the data for page loads (code adapted from [here](https://python.plainenglish.io/track-website-usage-with-postgresql-and-flask-53f583249911)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Define DB Models\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create two new database models (a.k.a tables). \n",
    "1. One will have the total number of page views per day \n",
    "2. The other will save the users' IP addresses and the dates on which they visited. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your `models.py` file, add:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Day(db.Model):\n",

    "\n",
    "We also *temporarily* update our dashboard route, to display the data that is currently in the `day` table. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. Synthetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add some fake page views to our database by opening your python shell and manually adding some data to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to make sure we have cleared any existing records (in case there's anything already existing). In the terminal:\n",

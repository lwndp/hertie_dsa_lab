Let's first create a simple bar chart as an example (example taken from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-visualization-with-plotly-and-flask-3660abf9c946)). You can either add this dashboard page to your own personal flask app (for which you have created your about page) or you can clone [this](https://github.com/henrycgbaker/my_flask_app_25) repo.\n",

    "\n",
    "First you need to get the correct **python modules and packages** in place:\n",
    "- Clone the repo\n",
    "- Add a `config.py` file (inside the `instance` folder, that you need to create inside the project root directory). \n",
    "    - The `config.py` file only needs to contain one line of code with a secret key (`SECRET_KEY='some password'`). \n",
    "- Make sure we have the correct packages installed in our flask environment:\n",
    "    - `flask-wtf`\n",
    "    - `plotly`\n",
    "    - `pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you need to **initialise the database** in a python shell:\n",
    "- in the command line run `python` while in the `my_flask_app` project root directory and with your flask environment activated\n",
    "- next, run the following (I recommend running it line by line to get a sense of what we're doing here):\n",

    "db.session.add(user)\n",
    "db.session.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- line 1: imports `db`: this is an instance of SQLAlchemy from our `flaskapp/__init__.py` module. This instance gives us access to database-related functionality, including table creation and querying.\n",

    "- line 3: tells SQLAlchemy to create all missing tables based on the models defined in `models.py`.\n",
    "    - If the tables already exist, this does nothing (it does not override existing tables).\n",
    "    - If this is the first time running it, it sets up an empty database with tables corresponding to all models.\n",
    "- line 4: creates a new `User` object in Python, *NB: it is not yet saved to the database*.\n",
    "    - The `User` constructor assigns \"Default user\" to the name column.\n",
    "    - At this stage, user is just an object in memory.\n",

    "\n",

    "    - *(This is where we will display the dynamic plotly graphs later, which will update for user page loads)*. \n",
    "- Within the `dashboard()` method, we will create the dataframe and create a plot with [plotly express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) (plotly module for the most common figures, e.g. bar charts) that is assigned to the variable `fig`. \n",
    "    - *NB: To include plotly figures in flask, we need to convert the plot to something called JSON format format using the `json.dumps()` and the JSON encoder that comes with Plotly.* \n",

    "We now create a dashboard for tracking the data for page loads (code adapted from [here](https://python.plainenglish.io/track-website-usage-with-postgresql-and-flask-53f583249911)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Define DB Models\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create two new database models (a.k.a tables). \n",
    "1. One will have the total number of page views per day \n",
    "2. The other will save the users' IP addresses and the dates on which they visited. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your `models.py` file, add:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Day(db.Model):\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Date, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    views = db.Column(db.Integer)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Initialise DBs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we create our database structure. To do this:\n",
    "- open a Python shell from our command line (while in the correct directory): `python`\n",
    "- run the below code\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Routing (`@app.before_request`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to create a path in our `routes.py` file that saves data to these tables, the moment a user loads a page. \n",

    "### 4. Routing (`@app.route('/dashboard')`)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also *temporarily* update our dashboard route, to display the data that is currently in the `day` table. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. Synthetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add some fake page views to our database by opening your python shell and manually adding some data to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to make sure we have cleared any existing records (in case there's anything already existing). In the terminal:\n",
    "\n",

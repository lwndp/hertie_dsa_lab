    "# Programming Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declarative Programming\n",
    "- **Definition**: \n",
    "  - Focuses on describing what should be accomplished without specifying how it should be done. \n",
    "  - Rather than writing instructions to be executed step-by-step, you define what you want done, and the underlying system or language runtime determines how to accomplish it.\n",
    "  - Emphasises on expressing the *logic* of a computation without describing its *control flow*.\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - Programs consist of *declarations* rather than *statements*.\n",
    "  - Focus on *what* rather than *how*.\n",
    "  - Logic and result are declared.\n",
    "  - Control flow is implicit and handled by the language or tool.\n",
    "- **Examples**: \n",
    "  - SQL: When writing a SQL query, you simply state the data you want returned—such as “all rows where age > 30”—and the database figures out how to retrieve it.\n",
    "  - HTML: Defining the structure of a webpage through tags. You describe the page layout and elements (like headings, paragraphs, or tables) rather than writing procedural instructions to render them.\n",
    "  - Regex: Patterns used to describe and match sets of strings without specifying how the pattern-matching algorithm works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imperative Programming\n",
    "- **Definition**: \n",
    "  - Involves providing a sequence of explicit instructions to the computer on how to perform a task step by step. \n",
    "  - Each instruction directly modifies the program state, guiding the process toward the desired outcome.\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - Programs are composed of statements and control flow constructs like loops and conditionals, that change a program's state.\n",
    "  - Focus on how to achieve the result; emphasises on describing step-by-step procedures.\n",
    "  - State changes are explicit and frequent.\n",
    "- **Examples**: \n",
    "  - C, Python: A loop that calculates the sum of an array. You write each step: initialize a counter, iterate through each element, add it to a total, and finally return the total.\n",
    "  - Java: Creating objects, calling methods, and updating fields in a specific order to achieve a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Programming\n",
    "- **Definition**: \n",
    "  - A paradigm where programs are composed of functions in the mathematical sense. \n",
    "  - Avoids mutable data and side effects, instead emphasizing the evaluation of expressions and function composition.\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - Functions are first-class citizens: they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned by other functions.\n",
    "  - No side effects: Calling a function with the same arguments always returns the same result, and no external state is altered.\n",
    "  - Emphasis on recursion and higher-order functions.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Haskell, Lisp, Erlang\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "- **Definition**: \n",
    "  - Organises software design around objects and data rather than actions and logic.\n",
    "  - Specifically, structures programs around objects, which combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods). \n",
    "  - The focus is on defining how objects interact with one another rather than just specifying procedures.\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - *Encapsulation*: Objects encapsulate data and behavior; this keeps data and methods that operate on it bundled together.\n",
    "    - Data is stored within objects, and methods define how this data can be accessed or modified.\n",
    "  - *Inheritance*: Classes can inherit attributes and behavior from other classes.\n",
    "    - A Truck class might inherit from Vehicle and add specific attributes like cargo_capacity.\n",
    "  - *Polymorphism*: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass; this enables the same interface to be used for different underlying data types.  \n",
    "    - A single method (e.g., `move()`) can work differently depending on the object (car, bike, or plane) that uses it.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Python, Java, C++\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ...how would we characterise R?\n",
    "R leans heavily towards a declarative and functional style for most statistical and data manipulation tasks, but it can support imperative and object-oriented approaches when needed.*\n",
    "  - *Declarative Aspects: you often describe data transformations, statistical operations, or visualizations without defining the underlying control flow explicitly. E.g. lm() to fit a linear model is more about declaring that a model should be built with certain variables, rather than detailing the iterative steps the algorithm must take.*\n",
    "  - *Functional Aspects: functions remain first-class objects, meaning you can pass them as arguments, return them from other functions, and compose them to build complex workflows. E.g. the purrr package.*"

    "* **Class Attributes**: Variables that are shared by all instances of the class. They are defined outside any method in the class.\n",
    "* **Instance Attributes**: Variables that are unique to each instance of the class. They are defined within the __init__() method.\n",
    "* **Methods**: Functions defined within a class. They operate on the object's attributes and represent the object's behavior.\n",

    "## Modules and packages in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, I gave a very brief refresher on Python modules (files ending in `.py`) and Jupyter notebooks (files ending in `.ipynb`). Let's have another look at modules and packages (this [introduction](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/) on modules and packages is a great resource):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Any code you write in a Python module can be accessed in other places by `import` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *(as long as the module is in the same directory as the script, or subdirectory as a package, or in a directory listed in Python’s sys.path)* \n",
    "\n",
    "* E.g. if you have created two files called `mod1.py` and `mod2.py` in your project, and you want to call a function called `foo()` from `mod1.py` in `mod2.py`, you do this by writing one of the following at the top of `mod2.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import mod1 \n",
    "\n",
    "    mod1.foo('something')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - The entire mod1 module is imported.\n",
    "    - You must use the module name (mod1) as a prefix to access its functions (`mod1.foo()` or `mod1.fun()`).\n",
    "    - Pros: Avoids naming conflicts and keeps code organized.\n",
    "    - Cons: Slightly more verbose due to the module prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "    or\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import mod1 as m\n",
    "\n",
    "    m.foo('something')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - The entire mod1 module is imported but is given the shorter alias `m`.\n",
    "    - You access functions using `m.foo()` instead of `mod1.foo()`.\n",
    "    - Pros: Cleaner and more concise, especially for long module names.\n",
    "    - Cons: May reduce readability if the alias is not clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "    or \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from mod1 import foo\n",
    "\n",
    "    foo('something')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Only the `foo` function is imported from `mod1`.\n",
    "    - You can call `foo()` directly without the module prefix.\n",
    "    - Pros: Cleaner syntax when only a few functions are needed.\n",
    "    - Cons: If multiple modules have a function named `foo`, it can cause naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    or \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # not recommended\n",
    "    from mod1 import * \n",
    "\n",
    "    fun('something')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - This imports everything (all public functions, classes, variables) from mod1 directly into the current namespace.\n",
    "    - Functions like `foo()` and `fun()` can be called without the module prefix.\n",
    "    - Namespace pollution: lose track of where functions and variables come from; debugging and readability take a hit; also hidden imports.\n",
    "    - If two modules have a foo() function, Python will silently overwrite one without warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modules vs Scripts\n",
    "* It’s a Python convention for organizing code that can be both run as a script and used as a module.\n",
    "    * Any Python module can also be run as a Python script (e.g. by running `python mod1.py` in the command line). \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if (__name__ == '__main__'):\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* So that Python knows what to do when a `.py` file is being run as either a module or a script, we can add the `if (__name__ == '__main__'):` clause at the end of the file:\n",
    "    - When a Python file is run directly (i.e. in the 'top-level code environment'), the special variable `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`, which means any code under if `__name__ == \"__main__\":` will only execute when the script is run directly, not when it is imported.\n",
    "    - everything that should only be run when the `.py` is being treated as a script goes underneath the `if` clause. E.g.:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        def foo(x):\n",
    "            return f'{x} is fishy'\n",
    "\n",
    "        if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "            print(foo('something'))\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - So if the script is run directly, the console output would be `something is fishy`.\n",
    "    - But, if the script is imported, the second block would not be run, so we would simply have access to the function `foo()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Packages are essential when managing a large collection of modules. \n",
    "    - They help you organise your code logically and make it easier to reuse and share with others, whether for personal projects or public distribution.\n",
    "* Creating a Package requires a specific folder structure: \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    package_name/         # Project directory (root)\n",
    "        package_name/     # Package directory\n",
    "            __init__.py   # Initialization file (required)\n",
    "            module1.py    # Module 1\n",
    "            module2.py    # Module 2\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - The package directory (which contains the actual `.py` files) must be nested within a project directory.\n",
    "        - The inner folder (package_name/) contains the Python modules and must include an __init__.py file to signal to Python that this directory should be treated as a package.\n",
    "    - `__init__.py:`\n",
    "        - required in the package directory (though it can be empty).\n",
    "        - tells Python that the folder is a package and can also be used to initialise the package or expose specific functions or classes.\n",
    "    - Additional Components in the Project Directory:\n",
    "        - `tests/`: A folder for unit tests to ensure your code works correctly.\n",
    "        - `docs/`: Documentation to explain how the package works and how to use it.\n",
    "        - `setup.py`: A script containing metadata and instructions for building and installing the package. This is essential if you want to distribute your package.\n",
    "        - `README.md`: A file describing the project, typically displayed on repository hosting platforms.\n",
    "    - Sharing packages\n",
    "        - To share your package with others (e.g., by publishing it on PyPI for easy installation via pip), you need to package it properly.\n",
    "        - This [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-upload-your-first-python-package-to-pypi/) guide provides a beginner-friendly walkthrough on how to create and upload your first Python package.\n",
